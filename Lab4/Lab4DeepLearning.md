# Lab 4: Deep Learning

In this lab we will use Keras framework to build deep learning neural networks to build a classifier that can assiss in recognition of handwritten digits.

For this lab we will use iPython notebook (Lab4DeepLearning.ipynb) that has the steps and more detailed explanations within the cells.
